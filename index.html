    <div class="story clearfix">
      <div class="bio bio-2">
        <p><strong>The first time I saw him he was fifteen feet in the air, climbing the towering chain link fence surrounding the tennis courts at our high school.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was fall of 2001, the beginning of our freshman year at West Linn High school. He jumped down (from way higher than any sane person would, but that’s typical Jeff) as if intrigued by something, I’ll admit, I was intrigued too.  After months of “the pursuit” Jeff and I began dating. Our first kiss was that winter, in the dance room at our High School where we would spend lunch together.  We took gymnastics together, then cheerleading. It was impossible to separate&nbsp;us; we went to several school dances, winter ball and prom, all the normal teenager stuff, football games and movie theaters.&nbsp;But we were by no means&nbsp;typical</p>
</div>
      <p class="bio bio-3">even back then it was clear that Jeff and I saw things a little different than the vast majority of our peers. I look back on our time in high school and it blows my mind how many of our habits, way of doing things and modes of expression are shaped by that valuable and vulnerable time from age 14-18. Jeff and I remained in contact throughout our post high school experiences, college, new jobs, moving from state to state. He was always the person I would call for a second opinion when I doubted myself, or really just needed a listening ear. After college I moved home to Oregon, and I’ll admit a little part of me was upset when Jeff told me just a few months before moving home that he would be moving to California. I suppose it was the recognition that I was bothered that really made things clear, I hadn’t realized how much I had been looking forward to coming home and having him there. We didn’t let distance get in our way, what is several&nbsp;hundred miles when you’ve known each other for almost a decade? I began flying to San Francisco when I could. I half expected things to be different, us to somehow be changed and all grown up, but when I was around him I slipped back into</p>
      <p class="bio bio-4">the carefree, less stressed version of myself I was in high school. We could still finish each other’s sentences. He really made me slow down and think about enjoying every moment, we found a elegant balance in each other’s presence. Jeff sees the bigger picture and the beauty of everything, even chaos. Since we began spending time together again we’ve learned a lot about life, and fortified each other’s weaknesses. Leaving San Francisco on Sundays became harder and harder. When he proposed to me in Napa I felt like everything that was supposed to happen did,  our relationship had come full circle and we reached a level of bonding higher than the one we had known for three years of tenacious closeness in High School. You know you’re in an amazing relationship when both people feel like they are the luckiest person in the world, like they’re getting away with something. My mom tells me “I always knew it would be Jeff”. Now that we’re getting married I realize… So did I.</p>

        <p><strong>When did I know that this was it, that Nicole was the one? I guess I've always known.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Seriously, you guys know me. Since we were kids, Nicole’s smile has lit up my world. I remember memorizing her class schedule freshman year just so I could <span>happen</span> to bump into her between breaks. I’d be hurrying through the halls just for the chance to make eye contact. Our first conversation was in october of that year and our first kiss shortly after. Soon we were inseparable. Our High School years were idyllic, full of light hearted fun and laughs. We traveled the nation with our cheer team and were closer than any two teenagers ever had a right to be. 

The next&nbsp;step in our lives was big, and scary, but&nbsp;</p>
</div>
      <p class="bio bio-6">we stayed in touch and helped each other through the rough road that is becoming an adult. Whenever a tough decision arose we were always just a call away. I remember when I told her that I wouldn't be there when she moved back home from college. I can still hear Nicole’s disappointment.But it was time, I had to make my mark and become the man that I knew I could. She was my only regret, the only thing that nagged at me as I left home. As I grew into my career Nicole was always there, on the phone and on my mind. She was the first person that I called when I got the job at Yammer. And when the time came, she was the first person that I wanted to share my newfound success with. So I flew Nicole down to see my new world. I can still see her eyes meet mine as she stepped through security that first time. That’s all it took, we were in love again. Like high school, we were laughing and crying; all the old jokes and memories flew back and</p>
      <p class="bio bio-7">we were just us, in a world that was all our own. And the astonishing thing is that over the next couple years, we only grew closer. We went from seeing each other every couple of months to seeing each other once a month, twice a month, weekly. Before we knew it we were in a relationship again, experiencing the world through each other’s eyes, minds, and hearts. We traveled, from Disneyland, to Hawaii, even to Thailand. We shared life. Two lives became one, and so it was only natural that we decided to share the rest of our life together. Some might say that being in a relationship is about compromise, communication, or forgiveness. But more than that I think it’s about understanding. Few couples can claim a level of understanding that equals ours; we've spent nearly half of our lives together. I can't tell you how excited I am that I get to spend the rest of my life with Nicole as well.</p>

    <h2 class="section">The Proposal</h2>
    <p class="description">I’m sure it’s no secret: Nicole and I are total wine snobs. I mean, we’re even getting married at a vineyard. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that I asked Nicole to marry me in Napa. What might be surprising is the real reason. Almost two years ago now, Nicole came down to visit me for a weekend and she and I, Dan and Hannah went out for an impromptu Napa adventure. It was one of those magical days, the kind that you remember with a slight sunny fog around the edges and sparkles in your eyes. It was the day that we KNEW that we were going to happen, that we were actually “A Thing”. Nicole says it was when she realized that she had fallen again, and this time we knew it wasn’t just a high school relationship, it was the real deal. Needless to say, there was no other choice of venue for me to propose. It had to be Napa, it had to be the very vineyard that we remembered. I set it up so that we’d get there in the beautiful afternoon light and I had a photographer hidden behind a tree (thanks Hannah!). I’ll never forget the look of wonder and excitement on Nicole’s face as I bent to my knee. My hands were shaking as I slipped the ring on her finger.

You get the idea, we'd like you're help making our honeymoon as romantic and memorable as possible!</p>
